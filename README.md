# PDD
Point Derived Dynamics is my first attempt at a generating forcefields from initial point positions.
It works by determining original parameters between points and then does its best to satisfy said parameters

Usage:
VS Code Live Server Extension
Run `python -m http.server` from the command line in the PDD folder

Currently I have a large 2d mesh, small 2d mesh, cube, and line implemented.
Any structure however can be implemented, as long as the structure's 3 dictionaries are filled out (structure from a file is not yet implemented).
